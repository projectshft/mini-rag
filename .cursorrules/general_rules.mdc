When creating a new API route always use typedRoute
[typedRoute.ts](mdc:app/api/typedRoute.ts)
To call this route use fetchApiRoute [client.ts](mdc:app/libs/api/client.ts)

Project structure:
app/components - shared components that are shared between pages
app/libs - 3rd party library
app/scripts - one off scripts to run outside the app
app/services - services we can call from API routes

This project is to teach early career devs about RAG so leave comments on certain features like using Pinecone or AI specific stuff so they can learn.
