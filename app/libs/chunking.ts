/**
 * Gets the last N characters worth of words from a text
 *
 * This is used to create overlap between chunks. We want complete words,
 * not cut-off characters, so we work backwards from the end.
 *
 * @param text The source text
 * @param maxLength Maximum length to return
 * @returns The last words up to maxLength
 *
 * @example
 * getLastWords("React Hooks are awesome", 10)
 * // Returns: "are awesome" (10 chars)
 * // NOT: "re awesome" (cut off "are")
 *

 *
 * Requirements:
 * 1. If text is shorter than maxLength, return the whole text
 * 2. Otherwise, return the last maxLength characters worth of COMPLETE words
 * 3. Build the result backwards to ensure you get the last words
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Check if text.length <= maxLength, if so return text
 * 2. Split text into words using .split(' ')
 * 3. Start with empty result string
 * 4. Loop through words BACKWARDS (from end to start)
 * 5. For each word, check if adding it would exceed maxLength
 * 6. If it would exceed, break the loop
 * 7. Otherwise, prepend the word to result (word + ' ' + result)
 * 8. Return the result
