Trigger a deploy to AWS. Break it. Fix it. Monitor it.\n\nThat’ll teach you more than any cert ever will."}]}

Projects. Conflict. Process improvements.\n\nIt wasn’t easy, even with a decade of experience and 25k+ followers.\n\nBut the formula hasn’t changed much: prepare, persist, and don’t take it personally."}]}
