/**
 * Fine-Tuning Training Data Upload Script
 *
 * This script uploads training data to OpenAI and creates a fine-tuning job to create
 * a custom model based on gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.
 *
 * WORKFLOW:
 * 1. Run this script to upload training data and start fine-tuning
 * 2. Monitor the fine-tuning job until completion (can take minutes to hours)
 * 3. Once complete, OpenAI will provide a fine-tuned model ID (format: ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal::XXXXXXXX)
 * 4. Update app/api/config.ts with the new fine-tuned model ID
 *
 * RELATIONSHIP WITH CONFIG.TS:
 * - The config.ts file contains model enums used throughout the application
 * - After this script completes fine-tuning, you MUST update the fine-tuned model ID in config.ts
 * - Replace 'ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal::BMIy4PLt' with your new model ID
 *
 * USAGE:
 * 1. Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment
 * 2. Run: yarn train
 * 3. Monitor the job via the provided dashboard link
 * 4. Update config.ts when the job completes successfully
 *
 * MODEL SELECTION GUIDE:
 * - Use 'gpt-4o-mini' for general queries or when fine-tuned model isn't needed
 * - Use the fine-tuned model (ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal::XXXXXXXX) for specialized tasks
 *   that benefit from the training data (typically LinkedIn-related queries in this case)
